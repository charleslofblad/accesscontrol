THE MANDATE MODEL
From Behörighetsresan@SJ to a Unified Identity Governance Framework
Whitepaper · Version 0.4 · 2026

Identity can persist. Authority can change.
The Mandate Model is the language between them.

Charles Löfblad  |  Markus Smed

Executive Summary
The Mandate Model did not begin as an academic theory.
It began with a practical enterprise question that emerged during real access-governance work at SJ:
Who owns the lifecycle of Identification and Authorization?
What started as an attempt to unify physical keys, access cards and digital permissions revealed a broader governance problem. The technology existed. The missing piece was a shared conceptual language across HR, IT, Security, Facilities and business ownership.
That observation became Behörighetsresan@SJ—a process-first description of how authorization follows people through onboarding, role changes, temporary assignments, project work and offboarding.
As the work matured, a second insight emerged.
The real object being transferred is not permission. It is authority.
The Mandate Model proposes that trusted identities do not receive access directly. Organizations govern authority through a Mandate connecting Identity, Organization, Role, Policy, Permission and Access, while Audit and Revocation provide evidence and lifecycle control.
The model is not intended to replace Microsoft Entra, RBAC, Zero Trust or Identity Governance platforms. It provides a governance vocabulary above existing IAM technologies and helps explain how physical and digital authorization belong to the same organizational process.
Version 0.4 develops this idea further by treating Mandate as the central conceptual object of authorization.
A Mandate describes not only what an actor may do, but why that authority exists, on whose behalf the actor is acting, within what scope and context, for how long, and under which policies and constraints.
This distinction becomes increasingly important as organizations introduce AI agents.
AI agents are not simply another type of software account. They can plan, invoke tools, access data, delegate work to other agents and continue operating across multiple steps with limited or no direct human intervention. Current work from NIST and Microsoft increasingly focuses on agent identity, authorization, delegated action, scope, least privilege, auditability and lifecycle control.
This introduces a new governance question:
Not only: Who are you? But also: Who are you acting for, under whose authority, for what purpose, and within what mandate?
The Mandate Model does not require AI agents to become a separate authorization domain.
Instead, an AI agent can be represented as an Identity, assigned Roles and governed through Mandates just as other organizational actors are. What changes is the nature and speed of delegation.
A human may delegate authority to an agent.
An agent may delegate a constrained task to another agent.
An agent may invoke a tool or service.
A service may access a resource.
Each step creates a potential delegation chain.
The Mandate Model provides a common conceptual language for governing that chain.
Not another IAM platform. A shared conceptual foundation for governing authority across humans, systems and AI agents.
1. A Practical Beginning
The Mandate Model emerged from a practical enterprise problem rather than from an attempt to create a new theoretical framework.
Physical keys were managed through one process. Access cards through another. Digital permissions through Microsoft Entra and other systems. Contractors, temporary assignments and organizational changes created manual exceptions across HR, IT, Security and Facilities.
The technology existed. The governance did not.
What appeared to be separate operational problems revealed a common authorization lifecycle:
•	Request
•	Approval
•	Assignment
•	Monitoring
•	Revocation
This became Behörighetsresan@SJ—a process-first way of describing authorization independently of individual systems.

The process exposed something deeper.
The organization was not simply assigning technical access. It was making decisions about who should have authority to act, under which circumstances, for what purpose, and for how long.
That distinction became the foundation of The Mandate Model.

2. Beyond Project Fragmentation
One of the recurring challenges in identity and access governance is not the lack of technology or individual solutions. It is the fragmentation that emerges when complex, enterprise-wide problems are divided into a series of smaller projects.
A project naturally needs a defined scope, a budget, an owner and a delivery date. This is necessary for execution. However, identity and access do not follow project boundaries.
A person may simultaneously have an identity, an organizational affiliation, a role, a mandate, policies, digital permissions and physical access. These relationships extend across HR, IT, Security, Facilities, applications and other organizational domains.
When each project addresses only one part of this chain, local solutions emerge. Each solution may be reasonable in isolation, while the overall landscape gradually becomes fragmented, difficult to navigate and difficult for users and administrators to understand.
This creates a recurring pattern:
Local problem → local project → local solution → new dependency → increasing fragmentation.
The problem is therefore not necessarily that an organization has too many projects.
The deeper problem is what happens when projects become the primary unit of governance.
A shared model instead of one large project
The Mandate Model does not propose replacing incremental projects with one large transformation program.
Such an approach would itself risk becoming too extensive, taking too long to deliver and eventually being divided into smaller initiatives.
Instead, The Mandate Model proposes a stable conceptual and governance layer that projects can share.
Projects can remain small.
Implementations can remain incremental.
Systems can evolve independently.
Organizational responsibilities can remain distributed.
But the underlying model for how identity, roles, mandates, policies, permissions and access relate to each other remains coherent.
This creates an important distinction:
Projects implement change.
The Mandate Model provides the common logic that connects the change.
The model therefore acts as a form of anti-fragmentation mechanism.
It allows different organizational units, projects and technology platforms to solve local problems without losing the larger context.
The model must survive the projects
Identity and access governance is a long-lived organizational capability.
Projects are temporary.
A project eventually ends. Its system may later be replaced, its team may change and its original documentation may become obsolete.
The organization, however, continues to employ people, assign roles, delegate authority and grant and revoke access.
For this reason, the governing model cannot depend on a particular project or technology implementation.
The Mandate Model is intended to provide that continuity.
It establishes a common language and structure that can remain stable while projects, systems and organizational structures change around it.
This means that an organization does not need to solve identity and access governance in one enormous initiative.
Instead, it can improve incrementally while maintaining a common direction.
The goal is not one giant project.
The goal is one shared model that survives many projects.
From fragmented solutions to a coherent journey
This is also the fundamental idea behind the Access Journey.
Identity and access should be understood as a continuous organizational journey rather than as a collection of isolated technical workflows.
A person joins an organization, receives an organizational context, takes on a role, receives a mandate, is granted permissions and access, changes roles or responsibilities, and eventually leaves.
The same underlying logic can produce different technical outcomes:
•	digital identities and accounts
•	application permissions
•	physical access cards
•	keys
•	vehicles and equipment
•	privileged access
•	machine and AI identities
These are different forms of access, but they originate from the same organizational question:
What authority has this identity been given, why does that authority exist, and how should it be governed over time?
The Mandate Model provides the common structure for answering that question.
In this sense, it is not another project competing with IAM, IGA or physical access systems.
It is a way of making the relationships between them understandable and governable.
Process before technology.
Governance before implementation.
A shared model before fragmented solutions.

3. From Process to Model
The central challenge was not simply how to manage access systems.
It was how to describe authority.
Managers delegate responsibility. HR establishes employment and organizational context. Security defines policy. Facilities administer physical access. IT provisions identities and applications. Business owners decide what a person or system should be allowed to do.
Everyone participates in authorization, but each function often describes it differently.
Access is not assigned directly from identity. Access is governed through a Mandate.
The conceptual chain is:
•	Identity Authority establishes trust.
•	Identity represents the actor.
•	Organization provides context.
•	Role describes responsibility.
•	Mandate represents governed authority.
•	Policy constrains that authority.
•	Permission expresses what may be performed.
•	Access is the resulting ability to enter, use, read, write, operate or invoke.
•	Action represents what actually happens.
•	Audit provides evidence of what happened and why it was authorized.
•	Revocation terminates the authority.
This distinction is important.
A Role describes responsibility.
A Mandate describes authority.
A Permission expresses an allowed capability.
Access represents how that capability is actually enforced.
Action represents what the actor actually did.
Audit provides the evidence that connects the decision to the resulting action.
The model therefore separates the organizational reason for access from the technical mechanism that implements it.
Physical keys, access cards, digital permissions, privileged roles and AI-agent capabilities can therefore be described using one governance language.

4. The Governance Problem in Modern IAM
Modern IAM platforms have become highly capable, yet organizations can still struggle with the governance relationships surrounding them.
HR may own the employment event; IT the digital identity; Security the policy; Facilities the badge or key; business management the responsibility; and multiple system owners the downstream enforcement.
Everyone owns part of the authorization process.
No single system necessarily owns the meaning of the authorization decision.
The Mandate Model addresses this conceptual gap by asking:
What is the governed authority that connects these decisions?
The answer is the Mandate.
It is therefore a governance layer, not a replacement for IAM.
The model does not attempt to move authorization away from existing systems.
Instead, it provides a conceptual structure that allows those systems to participate in the same authorization model.
A physical access system may enforce a mandate through a card.
Microsoft Entra may enforce it through a group or application role.
A privileged access system may enforce it through an elevated assignment.
An AI platform may enforce it through a tool or resource permission.
The implementation changes.
The underlying governance question does not.

5. Identity Authority
Version 0.2 introduced Identity Authority as a foundational concept.
Identity should not simply be assumed.
It must originate from a trusted source capable of establishing identity context and maintaining its lifecycle.
In many enterprise environments, Microsoft Entra ID or another authoritative identity system performs this role. The Mandate Model does not prescribe one technology; it defines the conceptual relationship.
Identity Authority establishes trust. The Mandate governs authority. Everything else becomes composition.
Authentication and authorization therefore remain distinct.
Identity establishes who or what is acting.
Mandate establishes why that actor has authority to act.
This distinction becomes even more important when the actor is not a human.
An application, service identity, AI agent or externally supplied software capability may have a valid identity without having any inherent authority within a particular organization.
Identity can persist. Authority can change.
The Mandate Model deliberately separates the two.

6. The Conceptual Building Blocks
The Mandate Model reduces enterprise authorization to a small set of conceptual building blocks.
These are deliberately small so the model can survive changes in technology.
The model distinguishes between four conceptual areas.
Organizational context
•	Identity Authority — Establishes trust and the source of identity.
•	Identity — Represents the actor: human, application, service, AI agent or other non-human identity.
•	Organization — Provides organizational context such as company, department, project or operating unit.
•	Role — Describes responsibility, function or organizational purpose.
Authority
•	Mandate — Represents governed authority to act.
•	Policy — Defines rules, constraints, risk conditions and organizational requirements.
•	Permission — Expresses the concrete capability or action that may be performed.
Enforcement
•	Access — Represents the resulting ability to enter, use, read, write, operate or invoke.
•	Enforcement systems — Implement the decision through physical or digital technologies.
Evidence and lifecycle
•	Action — Represents the actual operation or event performed by an actor.
•	Audit — Provides evidence of identity, authority, policy, permission, action and outcome.
•	Revocation — Ends or invalidates authority when its conditions are no longer satisfied.
The model deliberately does not introduce separate fundamental primitives for every new type of technology.
An AI agent is an Identity.
A delegation is a relationship between Mandates.
Context is a dimension of a Mandate.
A tool is an enforcement mechanism.
A trajectory is evidence of activity.
Everything else becomes composition.

7. Mandate as the Central Information Object
The Mandate is the conceptual centre of the model.
It is not simply another permission.
It is a governed statement that an actor has authority to perform certain actions, for a defined purpose, within a defined scope and context, under defined constraints.
A Mandate can contain or reference:
•	Actor — who or what holds the authority
•	Principal — who or what the actor is acting for
•	Issuer — who grants the authority
•	Purpose — why the authority exists
•	Role — the responsibility from which the authority may derive
•	Scope — which resources, systems, locations or domains are covered
•	Actions — what may be performed
•	Context — under which circumstances the authority applies
•	Policy — which rules and constraints apply
•	Validity — when the authority begins and ends
•	Parent Mandate — which existing authority the mandate derives from
•	Delegation — whether and how the authority may be passed onward
•	Revocation condition — what event or decision terminates the authority
A Mandate is governed authority to act within a defined purpose, scope and context.
The Mandate therefore answers questions that a permission alone cannot answer.
•	Why does this permission exist?
•	Who granted it?
•	On whose behalf is the actor acting?
•	What is the purpose?
•	Where does the authority apply?
•	When does it expire?
•	Which policies constrain it?
•	Can it be delegated?
•	What evidence must be retained?
•	What event terminates it?
This is the conceptual gap The Mandate Model is designed to address.

8. Relationship to Existing IAM
The Mandate Model does not attempt to replace existing IAM capabilities.
Instead, it provides a conceptual interpretation of how they fit together.
Existing capability	Mandate Model interpretation
Microsoft Entra	Identity Authority / Identity
RBAC	Role and Permission composition
ABAC / contextual authorization	Policy and Mandate context
Zero Trust	Policy-driven authorization and continuous evaluation
PIM	Time-bound or elevated Mandates
Identity Governance	Mandate lifecycle
Access Reviews	Mandate validation and governance
Audit / SIEM	Evidence of actions and authorization
Physical access systems	Access enforcement
API authorization	Permission and Access enforcement
AI agent identity	Identity representing a non-human actor
Delegated agent access	Mandate-to-Mandate delegation
These mappings are conceptual, not claims that the technologies are equivalent.
The Mandate Model sits above these implementation patterns.
It asks what organizational decision the technology is enforcing.

9. Physical and Digital Access as One Governance Problem
A key, badge, application permission and privileged role may be administered by different technologies, yet the organizational logic can be similar.
A person joins an organization, changes role, receives a temporary assignment and eventually leaves.
Their authority changes.
Their access must follow that change.
Behörighetsresan@SJ makes the lifecycle visible as a process.
The Mandate Model provides the conceptual language underneath it.
Process describes the journey. The model describes the authority. Systems enforce the decision. Evidence proves what happened.
This distinction allows a physical access system and a digital identity system to remain technically independent while still participating in one governance model.
A card is not the authority.
A key is not the authority.
An Entra group is not the authority.
An application permission is not the authority.
They are technical expressions or enforcement mechanisms derived from an underlying governance decision.
The authority exists at the organizational level.
The technology implements it.

10. The AI Workforce Changes the Question
Agentic AI introduces a new class of organizational actor.
AI agents can read data, call tools, write files, execute code, communicate and perform multi-step tasks with limited human supervision.
The resulting challenge is not simply identity management.
It is authorization across autonomous and semi-autonomous actors.
NIST's 2026 work on software and AI-agent identity and authorization explicitly addresses identification, authorization, auditing and non-repudiation for software agents, while its AI Agent Standards Initiative includes research into authentication and identity infrastructure for human-agent and multi-agent interactions.
The question is no longer only: Who are you? It increasingly becomes: Who or what are you acting for, under whose authority, and within what mandate?
This is where The Mandate Model becomes particularly relevant.
An AI agent may have a persistent identity.
But its authority should remain contextual, limited and revocable.
The same agent could therefore receive different Mandates in different organizational contexts.
The identity does not need to change merely because the authority changes.

11. Mandates for AI Agents
The model treats an AI agent neither as a human nor merely as anonymous software.
It can be represented as an Identity with an explicit relationship to an Organization, Role, Sponsor or owner, Principal, Mandate, Policies and Permissions.
A Mandate can define:
•	who or what the agent is acting for
•	the purpose of the delegation
•	the resources and tools it may access
•	the actions it may perform
•	the duration of the authority
•	the policies and conditions that constrain it
•	the context in which the authority applies
•	the audit evidence that must be retained
•	the event or condition that revokes the authority
This provides a common governance structure for both human and non-human actors.
The model does not require a fundamentally different authorization architecture for AI.
Instead, AI introduces new actors and new delegation patterns into the same conceptual framework.
An employee may act under a mandate.
An application may act under a mandate.
An AI agent may act under a mandate.
A service invoked by an agent may receive a further constrained mandate.
Authority should be explicit, scoped, attributable and revocable.
This direction is consistent with current Microsoft guidance for agentic identities, which emphasizes identity, explicit scope, tool access, least privilege and auditability, and with Microsoft Entra Agent ID's use of agent identities and constrained role assignments.

12. The Mandate Layer in an Agentic Architecture
The emerging agentic environment provides a useful real-world illustration of why governance and execution should be separated.
Modern agent architectures can contain several distinct layers.
An agent may have a persistent identity, a trajectory or event history, an inbox for incoming work, an activation mechanism, an orchestration or control plane, tools and APIs, permissions to resources, and an audit trail.
These components answer different questions.
The trajectory answers: What happened?
The context system answers: What does the agent need to know?
The inbox answers: What work has been sent to the agent?
The activation mechanism answers: When should the agent run?
The control plane answers: How do agents communicate, spawn work and coordinate execution?
The permission system answers: What technical operation may be performed?
The Mandate Model asks a different question:
Why is this actor authorized to perform this operation at all?
That distinction is central.
A trajectory is not a mandate.
An inbox message is not a mandate.
An activation is not a mandate.
A tool permission is not a mandate.
An Agent Control Plane is not a governance model.
They are mechanisms for recording, delivering, activating, orchestrating or enforcing actions.
The Mandate Model provides the conceptual authority layer connecting them.
A possible agent authorization chain
Human / Organization
        ↓
Mandate
        ↓
Agent Identity
        ↓
Delegated Mandate
        ↓
Agent Control / Execution
        ↓
Permission
        ↓
Tool / Resource Access
        ↓
Action
        ↓
Audit Evidence
The governance chain and the execution chain are related but not identical.
This distinction becomes increasingly important as agentic systems become more autonomous.
Lovable's current agent architecture provides a useful illustration. Its agents use durable trajectories to record what happened, inboxes to receive messages and an Agent Control Plane to orchestrate spawning, messaging and activation. The architecture deliberately separates history, context and execution.
From the perspective of The Mandate Model, this is precisely the distinction:
Execution infrastructure answers how agents work together.
The Mandate Model answers under whose authority they are allowed to work together.

13. A Mandate Chain for Agents
A human may authorize an agent.
An organization may authorize a supplier.
A supplier may provide an agent.
An agent may invoke another service or specialized agent.
Each step creates a potential delegation chain.
The key governance requirement is that authority should not silently expand as it moves through the chain.
A delegated Mandate should therefore be able to preserve or reduce the scope of the authority from which it originated.
This introduces a relationship between Mandates:
Parent Mandate → Delegated Mandate
The delegated mandate carries a traceable relationship to the authority from which it derives.
A delegated Mandate may preserve or reduce authority, but must not silently expand it.
Delegated Scope ≤ Parent Scope
This allows the model to represent:
Human → Agent
Agent → Sub-agent
Agent → Service
Organization → Supplier
Supplier → Agent
Agent → Tool
without requiring a different authorization model for each scenario.
Authority → Delegation → Constrained Mandate → Action → Audit → Revocation
The significance of this becomes clearer when an agent acts on behalf of a human and then delegates part of the task.
The downstream agent should not inherit unrestricted authority simply because it was spawned by the upstream agent.
It receives a mandate derived from the authority of its parent.
That mandate can be narrower in purpose, resource, action, time, environment, risk and autonomy.
This creates a governance boundary around multi-agent systems.

14. Context and Conditional Authority
Authority rarely exists in isolation.
A person may be authorized to enter a building only during working hours.
A contractor may access a project environment only for the duration of a contract.
An administrator may receive elevated authority only for a specific task.
An AI agent may be permitted to call a tool only when acting on behalf of a particular business process.
The Mandate Model therefore treats Context as a property of authority rather than as a separate authorization model.
Context may include:
•	Time
•	Location
•	Purpose
•	Resource
•	Task
•	Risk
•	Environment
•	Organization
•	Project
•	Device
•	Human supervision
•	Policy conditions
This allows a Mandate to express not only:
This actor may do X.
but:
This actor may do X, for this purpose, against this resource, within this context, during this period, under these constraints.
The Mandate becomes the place where organizational authority and contextual conditions meet.
This also provides a bridge between traditional enterprise authorization and agentic systems.
The same concept can govern temporary employee access and temporary agent access.
The mechanisms differ.
The governance principle remains.

15. Auditability Becomes More Important, Not Less
As agents become capable of performing many actions at machine speed, audit cannot simply record that an API was called.
The governance question becomes:
•	What identity acted?
•	Was it human, application or agent?
•	On whose behalf did it act?
•	Which Mandate authorized the action?
•	Who issued that Mandate?
•	Was the authority delegated?
•	Which parent Mandate did it derive from?
•	Which policy and permission allowed it?
•	Which tool or resource was invoked?
•	What context applied?
•	What changed?
•	When did the authority expire or get revoked?
Audit therefore becomes more than a technical log.
It becomes evidence of the authorization chain.
Mandate → Permission → Access → Action → Evidence
The evidence should make it possible to reconstruct not only what happened, but why it was allowed to happen.
This is particularly important for autonomous or semi-autonomous agents.
If an agent makes hundreds or thousands of decisions, the organization needs to be able to establish:
•	Who acted.
•	On whose behalf.
•	Under which authority.
•	Within which scope.
•	According to which policy.
•	With which result.
Audit is therefore not merely an operational output.
It is part of the governance model.
A trajectory can provide valuable evidence of what an agent processed and did, but the trajectory itself should not be confused with the authorization decision.
Audit records the exercise of authority.
The Mandate establishes the authority.

16. Why the Model Is Designed for Change
The technologies beneath identity and authorization will continue to change: directory platforms, access-control systems, AI models, agent protocols and organizational models.
A governance model should therefore avoid being tightly coupled to any one implementation.
Technology changes faster than governance concepts.
The Mandate Model provides a stable conceptual layer through which those technological changes can be governed.
Microsoft Entra may change.
Physical access platforms may change.
AI agent protocols may change.
Identity providers may change.
Organizations may change how work is structured.
Agents may be built internally, supplied externally, shared across organizations or created dynamically for a particular task.
The underlying governance questions remain:
•	Who is acting?
•	For whom?
•	Under whose authority?
•	For what purpose?
•	Within what scope?
•	Under which constraints?
•	For how long?
•	Can the authority be delegated?
•	What happened?
•	When does the authority end?
This is why the model is intentionally small.
The objective is not to predict the technology.
The objective is to provide a stable conceptual language for governing it.

17. The Core Information Model
The Mandate Model can therefore be understood as a conceptual information model rather than simply an authorization flow.
 
At its centre is the relationship between identity and authority.
Identity Authority
        ↓
Identity
        ↓

Permission
        ↓

The model can also be viewed as a governance relationship around the Mandate:

                          REVOCATION
The Mandate contains or references the essential dimensions of authority:
•	Actor — who or what holds the authority
•	Principal — who or what the actor is acting for
•	Issuer — who grants the authority
•	Purpose — why the authority exists
•	Scope — which resources, systems, locations or domains are covered
•	Actions — what the actor may perform
•	Context — under which conditions the authority applies
•	Policy — which rules and constraints govern it
•	Validity — when the authority begins and ends
•	Delegation — whether authority may be passed onward
•	Revocation — what event or decision terminates the authority
Identity establishes who can act.
Role describes responsibility.
Mandate establishes why and within what scope they may act.
Policy constrains that authority.
Permission expresses it.
Access enforces it.
Action records its exercise.
Audit proves it.
Revocation ends it.

18. The Core Insight
Authorization behaves more like organizational governance than software configuration.
A physical key.
An access badge.
A Microsoft Entra group.
A temporary project assignment.
A privileged administrator role.
An AI-agent tool permission.
Inside individual systems they appear unrelated.
Conceptually, they can represent the same organizational event:
Authority being granted, governed, exercised and eventually withdrawn.
Behörighetsresan describes how people—and potentially non-human actors—move through an organization.
The Mandate Model describes what moves during that journey:
governed authority.
This is the conceptual shift.
The model does not claim that a key and an API permission are technically the same thing.
They are not.
It claims that the organizational decision behind them can be described using the same governance language.
A mandate can result in a physical access right.
The same type of mandate can result in a digital permission.
Another mandate can authorize an AI agent to invoke a tool.
The technical enforcement differs.
The governance logic can remain consistent.

19. The Mandate Model and the Agentic Operating Environment
The development of agentic systems introduces a second important insight.
AI agents operate in an environment where state, execution and authority can become distributed.
An agent may have one identity, one trajectory, several tools, multiple delegated tasks and access to resources belonging to different systems.
An agent may also continue operating while new instructions arrive, fork work into subagents and return results asynchronously.
This means that the authorization model must survive asynchronous execution.
A message arriving in an inbox is not itself sufficient evidence that the receiving agent is authorized to perform the requested operation.
An activation waking the agent is not itself authority.
A tool becoming available does not by itself explain why the agent should use it.
The Mandate Model therefore provides an additional conceptual distinction:
Instruction is not authority.
Capability is not mandate.
Execution is not authorization.
History is not governance.
The instruction tells the agent what someone is asking it to do.
The Mandate establishes whether the actor is authorized to do it.
The Permission expresses the technical capability.
The Access mechanism enforces it.
The Action is what actually happens.
The Audit record establishes what happened and under which authority.
This distinction becomes increasingly important as autonomy increases.

20. Conclusion
The Mandate Model did not begin as an academic theory.
It emerged from a practical enterprise question:
Who owns the lifecycle of Identification and Authorization?
The journey from Behörighetsresan@SJ to The Mandate Model revealed that physical keys, access cards, digital permissions and emerging AI identities can be understood through the same conceptual language.
The model has evolved from a simple chain of Identity, Role, Mandate and Access into a broader conceptual information model.
Identity Authority provides the trusted foundation.
Identity represents the actor.
Organization provides context.
Role describes responsibility.
Mandate represents governed authority.
Policy constrains it.
Permission expresses what may be done.
Access is enforced.
Action represents what actually happens.
Audit provides evidence.
Revocation ends the authority.
Delegation allows authority to move between actors while preserving governance boundaries.
Context makes authority conditional rather than merely static.
This creates a model capable of describing both traditional enterprise access and emerging AI authorization without requiring separate conceptual frameworks.
The model does not attempt to predict the exact shape of the future AI workforce.
It prepares for multiple possibilities: internally built agents, externally supplied AI capabilities, shared agents, autonomous agents and delegated multi-agent workflows.
The future may change who—or what—does the work. The governance question remains the same: under whose authority is it acting?
The goal is still not another IAM platform.
The goal is a simpler conceptual foundation that makes future authorization platforms easier to design, explain and govern—across people, systems and AI agents.
Identity can persist. Authority can change.
Technology changes faster than governance concepts.
The Mandate Model is the language between them.
